# Overview

This project is a mobile application used to book and manage meeting rooms for a small company.

## Description

I made this project when I started an internship at BIWOCO (Vietnam - Australia technology company). In this project, I implemented Laravel as a Backend API server and Dio - a Flutter package - to make a request to a Backend server.
